# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** User describes what they want; Cauldron autonomously designs, decomposes, implements, tests, evaluates, and evolves until the goal is met with humans steering at key decision points.
**Current focus:** Phase 18 - Style Contract & Seed Evolution

## Current Position

Phase: 23 of 22 (fk cascade strategy)
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-02

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 65 (v1.0 shipped)
- Average duration: Historical v1.0 data preserved in archived phase summaries
- Total execution time: Historical v1.0 data preserved in archived phase summaries

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1-17 (v1.0) | 65 | Historical | Historical |
| 18-22 (v1.1) | 0 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: Historical v1.0 data
- Trend: Reset for new milestone

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.1 stays local-first: image generation must run against a project-owned, gitignored FLUX.2 dev bundle
- Acquisition must support both import-from-existing ComfyUI and guided upstream download
- Style clarity is a seed-quality concern, so low visual clarity should keep the interview open
- Image generation remains async-only and apps consume it through a local MCP surface
- [Phase 22]: Tests query pg_indexes and information_schema.table_constraints directly to verify DB-level constraint/index existence independent of Drizzle schema state

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 19 needs the exact required FLUX.2 artifact map and integrity strategy for guided acquisition
- Phase 20 needs a concrete runtime submission and observation contract for the chosen local execution path
- The runtime bundle must stay subset-only; copying the entire ComfyUI models tree remains out of scope
